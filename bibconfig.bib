abstract="The history and development of rapid prototyping originate from two main preceding techniques, topography, and photosculpture. Originating in the nineteenth century, these processes were initially very labor intensive. They later evolved to more modern techniques used in topography and metallurgy that resemble some current processes of rapid prototyping. These two techniques set the foundation for rapid prototyping as we know it today. Hideo Kodama from Japan and Charles Hull from the USA were the first to describe and develop a process and actual machines that were capable of printing in 3 dimensions (3D) and are considered the fathers of modern rapid prototyping. Rapid prototyping has evolved over time from a previously widely unknown field, to one with a broad range of applications from building bridges to printing human organs.",
